# BlockQuicksort
Code of BlockQuicksort and other algorithms tested in the paper "BlockQuicksort: Avoiding Branch Mispredictions in Quicksort" by Stefan Edelkamp and Armin Weiß (available at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274660, conference version at ESA 2016 https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6389/, preprint on arXiv under the title
"BlockQuicksort: How Branch Mispredictions don't affect Quicksort" http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06697).

This package consists of the following files:
- makefile
- driver.cpp : generates test cases and runs the sorting algorithms

- quicksort.h : contains different Quicksort main loops
- partition.h : contains different versions of the block partitioner and other partitioners
- median.h : functions for choosing pivot elements
- insertionsort.h : copy of insertion_sort from the GCC 4.7.2 implementation of std::sort

- interfaces for BlockQuicksort with different pivot selection methods / partitioners: blocked.h++, blocked_double_pivot_check.h++, blocked_double_pivot_check_mosqrt.h++, blocked_hoare_finish.h++, blocked_mo3_mo3.h++, blocked_mo3_mo5.h++, blocked_mo5_mo5.h++, blocked_Mo5.h++, blocked_mo23.h++, blocked_mosqrt.h++, blocked_simple.h++, hoare.h++

The method blocked_double_pivot_check_mosqrt.h++ performed in all benchmarks close to the optimum and therefore is shown in most plots in the paper. For comparison also the method blocked_simple.h++ is shown in most plots in the paper.

- stl_gcc : copy of std::sort from the GCC 4.7.2 implementation
- qsort3_aumueller.h++, rotations.h, inssort.h : three pivot Quicksort implemented by Timo Bingmann and Martin Aumüller http://eiche.theoinf.tu-ilmenau.de/quicksort-experiments/

- For running time experiments with one single algorithm:
	make <algorithm>.time
- For running time tests with different sets of algorithms and test cases (output  written to .csv file):
	make timetest
	make allAlgtimetest
	make pivotmethodtest
	make time-tests-data-all
	make blocksizetest-data

- For comparison and move experiments with one single algorithm:
	make <algorithm>.comp
	make <algorithm>.move
  These tests are not implemented for all algorithms.



# How to build single programs
Build a single algorithm can be done through: 
```
	make build ALGNAME="algorithm_name"
```

Build a single algorithm with a custom type: 
```
	make build ALGNAME="algorithm_name" TYPE="custom_type"	
```

#How to run
## Run single programs
```
	./a.out input_size distribution_type seed
```
distribution_type is given by 1 letter, see driver.cpp for further details, 
it has quite a few!. 

## Run tests
There are quite a few testing methods, I encourage you to go exploring yourself, however 
the most notable are listed below. 


### newtimetest
Runs all algorithms with the permutations defined in the variable: newsmalldata. 
We tested with the variable existingsmalldata

```
make newtimetest
```

### timetest
Existing method we do not implement. 
Runs a lot of tests with different types and permutations, takes a while!
```
make timetest
```

### perftimetest
Runs the perf state command on all algorithms, on all input sizes with random permutation.
Used to see instructions count, branches and branch misses. 

```
make perftimetest
```

### newblocksizetest
Runs blocksize tests on both blocked and multi-pivot blocked algorithms.
```
make newblocksizetest
```
